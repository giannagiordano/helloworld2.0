To create my Hello World 2.0 project, I reflected on what I distilled as the essence of my piece, 'momentum', when I was writing my most recent blog post. I concluded that 'momentum' is a representation of the uncertainty that I am feeling at this point in time, which is uncertainty about the future. I created 'momentum' to remind myself that, even though the future is uncertain, the words of people who inspire me and the beauty of my goals and dreams motivate me to move forward. I also hope that viewers of my sketch are encouraged to think about their own sources of inspiration and motivation.

Therefore, for my Hello World 2.0 sketch, I started with a black background. The darkness in the background of my piece reflects the fact that I am feeling in the dark about what the future holds for me. On the black canvas, there are three core elements of my piece. The first is the quote at the center. Depending on where the mouse is located, the quote is either Martin Luther King Jr.'s quote or Melinda Gates's quote. The second is the image at the lower righthand corner. Depending on where the mouse is located, the image is either Martin Luther King Jr. or Melinda Gates. I chose to include these quotes and images because the words of my role models are at the core of what is currently motivating me to move forward and work toward my goal of one day going to law school. I decided to only have one quote and one image on the screen at any given moment so the viewer can give the person and their words their undivided attention. In my previous sketch, having three quotes on the screen at one time was a bit distracting, and the viewer had to choose which one to focus on. The third core element is the star clipart, which moves with the mouse. This image symbolizes the goal I am currently reaching for. 

When the mouse is clicked, my piece changes. The background changes to an image of a starry night and at the top of the screen is a line of the same star clipart that is attached to the mouse. This adds to my piece because it represents the fact that I've experienced this feeling of uncertainty before. My entire life has been a starry night sky and by choosing to never give up and to keep moving forward, I have already reached so many goals. The anticipation of graduating college is the not the first time I have faced uncertainty, and it will certainly not be the last. My sketch serves as a reminder to myself and the viewer to "reach for the stars" because, even though the future is uncertain, there is always a reason to keep moving forward.
